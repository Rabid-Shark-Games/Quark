# Quark Engine

## What is the Quark Engine

The Quark Engine is Rabid Shark Games' game engine. It's meant to allow us to do whatever we want to, while still being open source and hopefully performant.

Some features we be taken from the Unreal Engine, however it is a clean room implementation. We're just implementing *what* it does, and not *how* it does.

Anyone who is working on any feature inspired by the Unreal Engine is asked to have never seen the official implementation.
